# Asteroid Run
###### A CINEMATIC SEQUENCE OF A SPACESHIP COLLIDING WITH AN ASTEROID

<br><br>

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a training scene in Unreal Engine, created as a background for a virtual production workflow. According to the brief, the scene must include Dynamic Environmental Composition and a Chain of Events with Secondary Consequences that unfold inside the virtual world.

The concept for my contribution is a space environment, where a spaceship travels through an asteroid field. An asteroid (with several smaller debris pieces) appears on its trajectory, leading to a collision event. This impact then triggers a set of secondary dynamic effects.

This drawing represents my early storyboard and event-chain concept for the project “spaceship colliding with an asteroid.”

The sketch contains three main components:

 - **Spaceship trajectory.**

>It shows the ship moving forward in one direction and approaching an asteroid field.

 - **Asteroid field.**

> A group of large and small rocks is drawn, moving toward the spaceship. Some of the rocks are intended to bounce off the ship on impact (dynamic environmental composition).

 - **Chain of secondary consequences.**

> After the collision, the main asteroid falls downward (toward a planet surface or deeper into space), while smaller debris pieces scatter around the ship, creating secondary effects-flashes, sparks, and changes in object movement.

An additional note includes a camera goal, indicating the planned cinematic angle to capture the event.

This sketch serves as a visual planning tool for building the event sequence inside Unreal Engine.

## 2.  My Role in the Team

The project was initially planned as a team assignment, but later our group was divided so that each student could complete an individual version of the task. This approach allowed everyone to demonstrate their skills independently, avoid delays, and eliminate shared responsibility issues.

As a result, the teamwork ended at the conceptual stage, and the full implementation of the scene was carried out by me individually.

## 4. Chain of Events and Secondary Consequences
## 5. Code and Blueprint Logic
## 6. Issues and Fixes

 - **Difficulties with GitHub**

> One of the tasks was to document the entire project creation process through GitHub. This includes tracking work stages, uploading updates, maintaining version history, and clearly demonstrating how the scene evolved throughout the development period.

I experienced challenges working with GitHub, especially with uploading the project and understanding the repository structure. Some parts are still not fully clear, but I believe that with more practice I will become confident using this tool.

 - **World-building logic and background setup**

> I had issues creating a proper background for the scene. Specifically, I couldn’t set up an HDRI environment or successfully import texture cubes (2D skybox elements) into Unreal Engine. I plan to return to this after completing the main task in order to improve the visual quality of the scene.

 - **Project restart**

> After the lecturer approved an individual approach, I restarted the project from scratch - approximately one week before the submission deadline. This was challenging but helped me better understand the structure and logic of assembling the scene.
> This is one of my early versions of the world layout, created during the initial stage of the project. However, after reviewing the brief and clarifying the requirements, I decided to rebuild the environment from scratch. On December 9th, I started assembling a new version of the project, incorporating the skills and improved understanding I had gained.

# My Intentions & Completed List 
##### December 9

For December 9, Start of Documentation - Plan
> Begin collecting media materials and documenting the first project steps in the README and Trello.

##### December 10

For December 10, I planned the following tasks related to the dynamic environment and visual effects:

- **Dynamic Environment Composition - Plan:**
> Set up an animated asteroid field moving toward the spaceship.
> Ensure that the asteroids’ movement and behavior change in real time.

- **Chain of Events and Secondary Consequences - Plan:**
> Configure the collision event between the spaceship and an asteroid.
> Add secondary consequences: debris scattering and trajectory shifts after the impact.

- **Engine Thrusters — Plan:**
> Add engine thrusters to the spaceship.
> Set up a glowing effect and a small particle stream to simulate propulsion.
> Use these effects to enhance realism and highlight the direction of movement.

*Result:*
- I added engine thrusters to the spaceship to create a visual propulsion effect. The thrusters include animated glow and a small particle stream that simulates engine activity during flight. This enhances the realism of the scene and clearly emphasizes the direction of movement.
