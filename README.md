# Asteroid Run - a cinematic sequence of a spaceship colliding with an asteroid.

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a training scene in Unreal Engine, created as a background for a virtual production workflow. According to the brief, the scene must include Dynamic Environmental Composition and a Chain of Events with Secondary Consequences that unfold inside the virtual world.

The concept for my contribution is a space environment, where a spaceship travels through an asteroid field. An asteroid (with several smaller debris pieces) appears on its trajectory, leading to a collision event. This impact then triggers a set of secondary dynamic effects.

This drawing represents my early storyboard and event-chain concept for the project “spaceship colliding with an asteroid.”

The sketch contains three main components:

 - **Spaceship trajectory.**
It shows the ship moving forward in one direction and approaching an asteroid field.

 - **Asteroid field.**
A group of large and small rocks is drawn, moving toward the spaceship. Some of the rocks are intended to bounce off the ship on impact (dynamic environmental composition).

 - **Chain of secondary consequences.**
After the collision, the main asteroid falls downward (toward a planet surface or deeper into space), while smaller debris pieces scatter around the ship, creating secondary effects-flashes, sparks, and changes in object movement.

An additional note includes a camera goal, indicating the planned cinematic angle to capture the event.

This sketch serves as a visual planning tool for building the event sequence inside Unreal Engine.

## 2.  My Role in the Team

The project was initially planned as a team assignment, but later our group was divided so that each student could complete an individual version of the task. This approach allowed everyone to demonstrate their skills independently, avoid delays, and eliminate shared responsibility issues.

As a result, the teamwork ended at the conceptual stage, and the full implementation of the scene was carried out by me individually.
